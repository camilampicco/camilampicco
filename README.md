Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm an Argentinian business administrator who is exploring UX UI design and Front-end fields.
I'm currently learning Javascript, and I'll continue with Vue.js and React - and who knows what else in the short future?

Ask me about UX and UI Design thinking and methodologies âš¡

This first project is to complete my UX UI Developer career at Coderhouse. I used HTML, CSS, SASS & BT. 

Hope you enjoy it!
